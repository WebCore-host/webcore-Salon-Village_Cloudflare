# Salon Village Icon Style Guide

To maintain a consistent, premium look and feel for the Salon Village Houston brand, all future icons should adhere to the following design principles:

## 1. Visual Language
- **Style:** Minimalist, linear (monolinear).
- **Line Weight:** Consistent `1.5px` stroke width for all icons.
- **Corners:** Use rounded caps and joins (`round`) to soften the geometric shapes while maintaining a professional edge.
- **Simplification:** Avoid intricate details. Focus on the core recognizable silhouette of the object.

## 2. Technical Specifications
- **Format:** SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).
- **ViewBox:** `0 0 24 24`.
- **Colors:** Primary use is Gold (`#D4AF37`) or Luxury White (`#F5F5F5`).
- **Responsive:** Icons should be wrapped in React components that accept a `className` prop for easy scaling and color manipulation via Tailwind CSS.

## 3. Spacing & Grid
- **Safe Zone:** Maintain at least `1px` of padding within the `24x24` grid to prevent clipping on some displays.
- **Center Alignment:** Visually center all icons within the frame.

## 4. Brand Tone
Icons should feel "premium" and "modern." Avoid playful or cartoonish styles. If an object is complex (like a car), use a sleek, stylized profile rather than a detailed illustration.
